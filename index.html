                          <h3>2.1 Wearable Technology</h3>
                          <p>The wearable technology, such as fitness trackers, smart clothing, and GPS devices, 
                            has provided athletes with valuable insights into their training and performance. 
                            These devices monitor vital signs, track movements, and gather data, enabling athletes to fine-tune their training routines and optimize their performance.</p>
                          <p>
                            In football for example, GPS devices are commonly used
                            and help coaches to assess specific movement demands of the players during training
                            sessions and competitions. Many studies of the reliability and validity of GPS in team
                            sports have been made from 2009 (Linnamo,  Vesa. (2023) Sensor Technology for Sports Monitoring. Special Issue Published in Sensors. Place of publication: mdpi.)
                            confirm that the use of GPS can be a the differential between amateur and high-level sports.

                          <p>
                            Data analysis in sports its crucial for the high level competition. The global sports market grew from $354.96 billion in 2021 to $496.52 billion in 2022,
                             according to the business research company's research, making it one of the biggest markets in the world.
                             As spending in the global sports market increases,
                             sporting teams are much more committed to investing in sports data analytics for a competitive edge, 
                             hence the projection of the sports analytics market reaching upwards of $4.5 billion by 2025.

                          </p>
                          <p>Fundamentally, sports data analysis uses statistics to recognise patterns in athletic performance, 
                            and to generate insights that can inform strategies to boost player or team health and performance.

                            The sports industry leverages data analytics in a number of ways. 
                            Athletes and coaches use data-gathering systems to analyse and enhance performance, while broadcasters use sports analytics
                            to discuss team performances and trends.</p>

                        <p>Sports-related injuries are a major concern for athletes.
                           Technology plays a significant role in preventing injuries by monitoring athletes' condition in real-time. 
                           Smart clothing embedded with sensors can detect anomalies in heart rate, temperature, and muscle fatigue, 
                           alerting athletes and trainers to potential issues before they escalate.
                           Sports technology is not an area commonly thought of when we are talking about the latest high-tech innovations. 
                           However, technology is used a great deal in athletics, and now more is being developed to keep players safe and healthy.
                            Sports injuries can be devastating by ending careers and causing lifetime damage to a playerâ€™s body (Alliancetech. (2015) The Latest Sports Technology Available To Prevent Sports Injuries.)</p>

                        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                        <p>
                          The integration of technology in sports raises important ethical considerations. Athletes' use of advanced equipment and wearables may confer unfair competitive advantages,
                          leading to concerns about fairness (Ruichu Cai and Li Wang (2017) DITIR: Distributed Index for High Throughput Trajectory Insertion and Real-time Temporal Range Query August 2017). 
                          Additionally, the introduction of video replay systems, while aiming to enhance fairness,(such as the VAR at football) can also disrupt the spirit of sportsmanship (Haugen, K. K., & Nygreen, E. (2015). Video technology and the value of sport. International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching, 10(4), 663-676. ).
                          Athlete health and privacy are significant concerns, as wearable devices and sensors collect physiological data, necessitating informed consent.
                          The distinction between legitimate performance enhancement and doping blurs when technology is heavily involved (Sparrow, R., & Sparrow, L. (2006). In the hands of machines? The future of aged care. Minds and Machines, 16(2), 141-161.).
                          Lastly, disparities in access to cutting-edge technology create inequalities in sports, where financial resources dictate access to advanced equipment, challenging the concept of fair competition (King, A. J., & Chassiakos, Y. L. R. (2020). Sport and ethics: Legal, psychological, and medical issues. Pediatric Clinics, 67(3), 595-602. )
